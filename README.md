This is a VHDL 'program' I wrote as the final project for my Advanced Digital Design course. 

This is a game where 2 players control squares (with joysticks) to attempt to knoch each other off the platform. 
Score is tracked on the 7-segment display. 
Video is displayed over VGA.

Players can also change their square's mass (H/M/L) using the 1,2,3 and numpad 1,2,3 keys for each player.

# Requirements
* USB Keyboard
* Basys 3
* 2x PmodJSTK2s (Connected to JA / JB)
* VGA Monitor
